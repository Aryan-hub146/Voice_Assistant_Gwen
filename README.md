Problem Statement:
In modern computing, voice assistants are often limited by rigid voices, poor contextual understanding, and lack of personalization. Many solutions also fail to offer a seamless, always-available interface that blends voice interaction with visual feedback for real-world productivity.

Solution Overview:
GWEN is a production-grade AI voice assistant designed to deliver natural, human-like interaction with dynamic voice cloning, real-time animated waveforms, and wake-word activation. It remains visible and responsive from the moment the wake word is detected until the command execution is complete, providing intuitive visual feedback alongside voice output.

Key Features:

Dynamic Voice Cloning using ElevenLabs API to speak in the userâ€™s own voice.

Real-Time Animated Waveform for visual feedback during speech.

Wake Word Detection for hands-free activation.

System Tray Integration & GUI Panel for quick control.

Command Execution for real-world tasks like opening apps, fetching data, or controlling smart devices.

Real-World Impact:
GWEN can be used in accessibility tools, smart homes, and productivity setups where users benefit from hands-free interaction combined with personalized speech and visual cues. It bridges the gap between AI-driven automation and human-like engagement, making it more inclusive and user-friendly.
